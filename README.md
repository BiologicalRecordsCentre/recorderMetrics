# recorderMetrics

An R package for the analysis of recorder behaviour in citizen science projects. This package takes data from citizen science projects that have 'what' (typically species), 'where', 'when', and 'who' fields. From this data the various functions in this package create metrics that quantify the behaviour of the participants (the 'who').
